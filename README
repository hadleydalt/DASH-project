My code does not successfully implement linking. 

My intention was for the user to be able to create folders and name them. If a node is on the canvas, the user is able to add
it to a certain folder. This happens with the node, marked with an ID upon instantiation, being added to an array for that folder.

The user can then press "View Folder Contents" and a message pops up indicating how many nodes have been added to that folder. 

This is all implemented successfully and the message returns the correct amount of nodes! It also lists the nodes that 
have been added for the folder. 

I intended for the user to be able to click on the nodes in this list and that would display the node in question. 

However, I was unable to implement this successfully due to time constrictions.

I updated this README at 12:01 because I realized I had not saved before committing but everything else was committed at 11:59!

EDIT: specifications and commentary
(I unfortunately did not have time to clean up the code or add detailed annotations. I know this is my fault and I would be happy to 
provide annotations within the next few days). 

When adding an iFrame, you have to click ON the word "HERE" before you can type in the website. 

Do not add a node to multiple folders - this is a bug.

You can create a collection within a collection infinitely but you cannot create multiple collections within a collection. This is because I was 
unaware of how to use the Map function to nest. I have an entire plan and pseudo code written out for re-implementation with the Map function so that you
can create multiple collections within a collection.
