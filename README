My code does not successfully implement linking. 

My intention was for the user to be able to create folders and name them. If a node is on the canvas, the user is able to add
it to a certain folder. This happens with the node, marked with an ID upon instantiation, being added to an array for that folder.

The user can then press "View Folder Contents" and a message pops up indicating how many nodes have been added to that folder. 

This is all implemented successfully and the message returns the correct amount of nodes! It also lists the nodes that 
have been added for the folder. 

I intended for the user to be able to click on the nodes in this list and that would display the node in question. 

However, I was unable to implement this successfully due to time constrictions.
